# Spotify Top Tracks & Artists App

A personalized music dashboard that displays your most listened to artists and songs using the Spotify Web API. Get insights into your music taste with an elegant, responsive interface. If you'd like to try it, could you send me a message to put you on the auth list? I would need your Spotify email. Sorry, but I haven't submitted a quota extension request.
